# JavaScript Null Value Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in JavaScript related to how null values are handled in arithmetic operations. The provided code seems to correctly handle null values through explicit null checks, yet this approach can mask potential problems.  The solution demonstrates a more robust and defensive way to deal with potentially null values in your arithmetic operations.  Consider this when writing functions that depend on the arithmetic combination of various inputs.

## Bug Description

The original code attempts to handle null values by returning 0 if either input `a` or `b` is null. However, in more complex scenarios, this simplistic approach can lead to unexpected behavior.  The core issue is that this solution only explicitly checks for null values and does not account for other potential issues like undefined values or non-numeric inputs that may result in errors or unexpected outputs.

## Solution

The solution employs a more robust approach by first checking if a value is of the appropriate type (Number) and then performing arithmetic.  This added type checking avoids unexpected behavior from values of the wrong type, thus providing more reliable and predictable results.
